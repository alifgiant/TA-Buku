\chapter*{Abstract}

In 2015 it was estimated that 17.7 million deaths were caused by cardiovascular disease (heart disease). In heart disease is often characterized by the emergence of irregular patterns in the heart rate of a person. This pattern is known as Arrhythmia. Knowing the occurrence of this pattern can save many lives. But the skill to analyze heartbeat patterns is only shared by those who have had health education like heart doctors. In several previous studies, various non-invasive heart rate measurement methods have been developed and a method of detecting the occurrence of arrhythmias has been developed. However, the existing system can not provide early warning when the arrhythmia occurs. This final project proposes an early warning system design to alert the nearest person and or doctor about the occurrence of arrhythmias.
